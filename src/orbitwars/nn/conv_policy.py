"""Centralized per-entity-grid conv policy for Orbit Wars (W4 candidate A).

**Status**: SKELETON. Architecture decisions frozen; forward pass body is
stubbed. This is the *primary* candidate for the W4 architecture bake-off
per the plan — Set-Transformer (see ``set_transformer.py``) is candidate
B. Pick winner by 1M-step training result, not a priori.

**Why this architecture?** Lux S1/S3 winning submissions used centralized
per-entity-grid conv policies over a dense spatial tensor. The recipe:

  1. Render the game state onto a ``(C, H, W)`` grid where each channel
     is one entity feature (ships_owned_0, ships_owned_1, production,
     is_comet, sun_distance, ...). H=W=50 or 100 gives a spatial
     resolution that captures intercept geometry without blowing up
     the activation volume.
  2. Run a small conv backbone (4-8 residual blocks, 64-128 channels).
  3. Emit two heads:
       * **Policy head**: per-planet action distribution, decoded by
         indexing the output grid at each owned planet's (x, y) slot.
       * **Value head**: scalar game value via global average pool.

**Why it beats a flat MLP / set-transformer on RTS:**
  * Spatial locality is the dominant structure (nearby planets interact,
    far planets don't). Conv's inductive bias matches the game.
  * Translation equivariance on the mirror-symmetric board is free data
    augmentation: a conv filter trained in one quadrant generalizes
    automatically to the other three.
  * O(H*W) compute vs O(N^2) attention — cheaper at N=40 planets and
    scales better if we move to 100+ entity boards in later iterations.

**Parameter budget:**
  * Target: <2M params total after distillation (W5 deliverable —
    Bayesian Policy Distillation to <2M student).
  * W4 teacher: 5-20M params is fine; student is what ships.

**Training pipeline (not in this file):**
  * Feature encoding: ``orbitwars.features.obs_encode`` (stub today).
  * PPO loop: ``orbitwars.train.ppo_jax`` (not yet created).
  * PFSP opponent pool: ``orbitwars.training.pfsp_pool`` (not yet created).
  * Distillation: ``orbitwars.nn.distill`` (not yet created).

**Dependencies:** ``torch`` 2.11.0+cpu is installed as of W3 tail. CPU-only
for now; swap to the CUDA build on the local RTX 3070 when PPO training
starts. The torch modules below are live — obs_encode.py is shipped,
action decode (ACTION_LOOKUP below + planet_to_grid_coords) is in place,
and forward-pass smoke tests pin shape + dtype (see tests/test_nn_forward.py).
