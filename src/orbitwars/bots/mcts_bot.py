"""Path B bot: Gumbel top-k + Sequential Halving over heuristic rollouts.

Integration of `orbitwars.mcts.gumbel_search` behind the `Agent` contract.
On each turn we:
  1. Enumerate per-planet candidate moves via the heuristic's scorer.
  2. Sample K joint actions via the Gumbel top-k trick.
  3. Allocate a rollout budget with Sequential Halving.
  4. Return the highest-mean-Q joint's wire format.

Safety:
  * We stage a heuristic action by EARLY_FALLBACK_MS so a search blow-up
    never results in a no-op turn.
  * Any exception inside search falls back to the staged heuristic move.
  * Rollouts respect an internal hard deadline well below actTimeout.
