"""Frozen archetype bots (Path D).

A small catalogue of stylistically-distinct heuristic configurations, each
implemented as a ``HeuristicAgent`` with a tailored override on top of the
default ``HEURISTIC_WEIGHTS``. Their job is twofold:

  1. **Opponent model prior** (Path D): the Bayesian posterior tracks
     P(opponent plays like archetype_k | actions observed so far). Each
     archetype is a frozen policy that scores opponent moves via its
     deterministic heuristic — the posterior-weighted mixture feeds MCTS
     opponent rollouts.

  2. **Training opponents** (Path C): PFSP needs a permanent pool of
     scripted baselines mixed into the self-play schedule (microRTS 2023
     recipe). These archetypes give us diversity without training them.

Design constraints:

  * Each archetype must be a *plausible* strategy a human or bot author
    would write. If we pad the portfolio with adversarial or broken
    configurations the posterior becomes a noise classifier.
  * Archetypes should be separable — an observed action sequence should
    have different likelihoods under different archetypes. Identical
    behavior under different names is wasted posterior dimension.
  * Weights should be *far enough* from defaults to be stylistically
    distinct, but not so degenerate that the archetype self-destructs;
    every archetype must at minimum beat a no-op bot.

Non-goals:

  * We are NOT trying to build the strongest possible heuristic variants
    here — TuRBO/EvoTune do that. Archetypes are stylistic caricatures.
  * We are NOT modeling learned opponents (AlphaZero-style bots). Those
    don't fit a 7-dimensional Dirichlet well anyway. If a learned bot
    appears on the ladder, the posterior will spread mass over whichever
    archetypes its behavior most resembles turn-by-turn, and that's fine
    — the exploitation headroom is still meaningful.

Public surface:
