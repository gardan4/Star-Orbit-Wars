"""BOKR-style kernel regression over UCB values for continuous-angle sub-actions.

Inspired by Ji et al. 2025 (Bayesian Optimized Kernel Regression for
continuous-action MCTS; validated on orbital planning tasks). The idea:

  * Classical progressive widening treats each newly-added angle as a
    fresh arm and tracks per-angle visit/value statistics independently.
    With a 1-second budget we expand ~O(10-50) rollouts per planet —
    not enough to separate signal from noise on 20 candidate angles.
  * Kernel regression shares value across nearby angles via a Gaussian
    kernel `K(θ, θ') = exp(-((θ-θ')/h)^2)`. The estimate at candidate θ
    becomes a weighted average of ALL observations, not just those that
    landed on θ exactly. Small angle perturbations then accumulate
    evidence together — much higher sample efficiency.
  * An exploration bonus on the "effective visit count"
    `n_eff(θ) = sum_i K(θ, θ_i)` gives the UCB term. Angles far from
    prior observations have low n_eff → high bonus → explored next.

Why this fits Orbit Wars specifically:

  * The heuristic emits one analytic intercept angle per target; nearby
    angles (±5-10°) correspond to ships that pass the target on one side
    or the other — materially different trajectories for orbiting
    targets. Pure argmax from heuristic misses this continuous structure.
  * Angles wrap modulo 2π. The kernel here operates on the circular
    angular difference so θ=0 and θ=2π-ε are treated as neighbors.
  * We deliberately keep this a root-level refiner: given a base angle
    from the heuristic, it proposes a fine grid around it and picks
    which grid point MCTS should rollout next. No tree surgery required.

Scope of v1 (this module):

  * Standalone `BOKRKernelSelector` class.
  * Per-planet / per-target lifetime: construct with the analytic
    intercept angle, accumulate (angle, value) observations via
    ``update``, query ``select`` for the next angle to rollout, and
    ``best_angle`` for the final pick.
  * No neural value prior; no GP hyperparameter tuning; no shared
    kernel bandwidth across planets. All can be added later.

Non-goals for v1:

  * Wiring into ``generate_per_planet_moves`` — that requires a dynamic
    candidate set mid-search and is a heavier refactor we'll land after
    this module ships and soaks.
  * Full Bayesian posterior over the value surface. BOKR's original
    formulation uses a GP; we use kernel regression + UCB because the
    inverse-kernel-matrix solve is too expensive under a 1-second budget.

@dataclass
class BOKRKernelSelector:
    """Kernel-UCB selector over a fine angle grid around a base angle.

    Usage (per-target at a root decision):

        sel = BOKRKernelSelector(base_angle=analytic_intercept)
        for _ in range(sim_budget):
            theta = sel.select()                          # pick next angle
            value = rollout_at_angle(theta)               # MCTS rollout
            sel.update(theta, value)                      # record result
        final_angle = sel.best_angle()                    # argmax of kernel mean

    Attributes:
        base_angle: center of the grid — typically the heuristic's
            analytic intercept angle for a given target.
        angle_range: radians ± around ``base_angle`` covered by the grid.
            Default 0.2 rad (~11 deg) — wide enough to find a pass-either-
            side improvement, narrow enough that the kernel still shares
            meaningful evidence.
        n_grid: how many grid points inside the range (inclusive of
            both endpoints; ``n_grid`` must be ≥ 1 and is clamped to odd
            so the base angle is always a grid point).
        kernel_h: Gaussian-kernel bandwidth. Default = 0.5 * grid spacing.
        c_ucb: UCB exploration constant. 1.4 mirrors the non-root PUCT
            setting in gumbel_search; pick lower under very noisy
            rollouts (c=0.7) and higher when the value surface is smooth.
        rng_seed: optional; only used to break ties in ``select``.
